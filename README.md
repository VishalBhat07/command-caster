# **CommandCaster**

CommandCaster is a versatile, voice-activated assistant built using Python. It leverages speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and AI-driven responses to simplify your interaction with various digital services. Whether you're fetching the latest news, playing music, or just exploring the web, CommandCaster has got you coveredâ€”all through simple voice commands.

## **Features**

- **Voice Recognition**: Utilizes `speech_recognition` to understand and execute spoken commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text to natural-sounding speech using `pyttsx3`, providing audible feedback for your commands.
- **Web Integration**: Opens websites and plays music directly through voice commands, with support for platforms like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, and more.
- **News Fetching**: Retrieves the latest headlines from a news API and reads them aloud.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Integrates with AI models to provide detailed and helpful responses to general queries.
- **Customizable Wake Word**: Trigger the assistant using a custom wake word, such as "Apollo".
